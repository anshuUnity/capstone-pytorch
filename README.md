## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images of food into 101 different categories. Image classification in food recognition is important for applications such as dietary monitoring, restaurant recommendation systems, and culinary education.

## Dataset

The Food-101 dataset consists of 101,000 images, with 1,000 images for each of the 101 food categories. The dataset is well-suited for training deep learning models due to its size and diversity.

- **Number of classes:** 101
- **Number of images:** 101,000
- **Source:** [Food-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)

## Model Architecture

The project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which is fine-tuned for the Food-101 classification task.

- **Base Model:** ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Additional Layers:** Global average pooling, dropout, dense layer for classification

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

To improve the model's performance, data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are applied.

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Resizing images to 224x224 pixels
  - Normalizing pixel values

- **Augmentation:**
  - Random horizontal flip
  - Random brightness adjustment

## Training Process

The model is trained in two phases:

1. **Initial Training:**
   - Number of epochs: 10
   - Batch size: 32
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Base layers frozen, only additional layers trained

2. **Fine-tuning:**
   - Number of epochs: 10
   - Batch size: 32
   - Learning rate: 0.00001
   - Entire model trained

## Evaluation Results

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The following visualizations provide insights into the training process and model performance:

- Training and validation accuracy plots
- Training and validation loss plots
- Confusion matrix

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/food101-pytorch.git
cd food101-pytorch
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

To predict the class of a single image, run:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the prediction function:

```python
# Load the model
model = torch.load('path_to_trained_model.pth')
model.eval()

# Predict the class of an image
prediction = predict_image('path_to_image.jpg', model, class_names)
print(f"Predicted class: {prediction}")
```

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed a high-accuracy model for classifying images from the Food-101 dataset. Future work could involve experimenting with different architectures, further fine-tuning, and deploying the model in a real-world application. Additionally, improving the model's interpretability could provide more insights into its decision-making process.
